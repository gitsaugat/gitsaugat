I build data systems that turn operational complexity into measurable business insight.

With 3+ years of experience across healthcare, academic, and digital environments, I design KPI-driven reporting infrastructure and scalable data workflows that enable faster, evidence-based decision-making.

My work sits at the intersection of analytics and engineering:
	•	Structured and optimized 9M+ records to support operational and financial reporting
	•	Reduced reporting turnaround time by 80% through workflow automation
	•	Designed longitudinal KPI models used to evaluate program performance
	•	Built scalable data systems enabling reliable reporting and cross-team visibility
	•	Developed forecasting and performance dashboards supporting strategic planning
	•	Deployed and managed cloud-based data systems on AWS (EC2, IAM, Lambda)

I view data as decision infrastructure—not just analysis.

Technically, I specialize in SQL performance optimization, Python automation, ETL pipeline design, scalable BI reporting systems, and cloud-based data deployments. Strategically, I focus on defining the right metrics, enforcing data integrity, and building reporting frameworks that scale with business growth.

Open to data engineer, analytics engineer, BI analyst, data analyst, data-driven backend systems, and strategy roles across the U.S. and Canada.
